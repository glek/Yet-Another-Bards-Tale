The GameEventListener should pass an IllegalStateException or other
RuntimeError (must be a checked exception).

Events should only be added to the command history *after* the lower classes in
the 'event directed acyclic graph' have successfully processed further
generated events.

The controller must handle exceptions passed up, the viewer obvious displays
them.
